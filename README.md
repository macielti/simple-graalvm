# Simple GraalVM

A Leiningen template inspired by [Clojure GraalVM project](https://github.com/clj-easy/graalvm-clojure).

The idea is to provide a simple boilerplate project to validate if a lib is compatible with GraalVM native image
generation process.

## Usage

1. Create a new project based on the template:

``` bash 
lein new net.clojars.macielti/simple-graalvm myproject
```

2. Populate the project with a hello word example for the lib you want to experiment with.

3. Generate the native image:

``` bash 
lein do clean, uberjar, native
```

4. Execute the output native image:

``` bash 
lein run-native
```
